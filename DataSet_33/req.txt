the DataSet_33.csv file contains records for 97 countries around the world on indicators related to the business environment, the observed variables are as follows:
1. start-up procedures
2.tax payments
3. time required
4. time to pay taxes
5. tax rate
6. revenue
7. foreign investment
8. high-tech exports

1. determine and save in the StdCov.csv file the variance-covariance matrix corresponding to the standardized numerical variables of the DataSet_33.csv

2. determine the principal components and save them into the PrinComp.csv file.

3. Plot the variance explained by the principal components using a line plot, along a horizontal line corresponding to the variance equal to one.

4. determine the factor loading matrix and plot the correlogram along with the factor loading values(2 decimal precision), employing the heatmap plot from the seaborn package.
